### Need Help?
If you have questions, please ask!  I'm here to help.  I welcome students to
drop by office hours to work on their projects, listen to questions others might have,
or chat about other CS topics, grad school, etc.

Additionally the Computing Success Center, located in MAK A-1-101,
is a great place to get help or simply hang out.
It offers free drop-in tutoring for a variety of College of Computing courses
throughout the week during the academic year.
See the Computing Success Center webpage for a current schedule,
including when help is available for specific courses.
Additionally, free one-on-one tutoring appointments are through the
