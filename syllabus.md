## Catalog Course Description

Programming methodology, design and analysis of algorithms, and an introduction to data structures. Examples from a wide range of computing applications will be discussed.

Prerequisites: MTH 122 or MTH 124 or placement into MTH 201 or above through Grand Valley math placement, and a C or better in either CIS 159 or CIS 162.


## Why Take This Course?

Computational thinking is a critical skill to develop whether you are pursuing a career in a computing field or simply pursuing your own curiosity. We will explore problem solving strategies and algorithmic thinking that develop your logical reasoning. You will gain proficiency in object-oriented design and see different application areas for programming. These words all sound great, but what do they mean for you? Over the course of this semester, you'll be building critical thinking and problem solving skills to process a problem, break it down into its constituent parts, and craft a solution. Building these skills and learning a language (both programming language and terminology) in which to carry out this process is the ultimate goal of this course
.
## AI Use Policy

The introduction of LLM code tools such as GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT are actively changing how software is developed.  In just the past two years we’ve seen these tools widely adopted across industry and many stories about the nature of coding work changing.  While that is the case, the most crucial skills that employers desire are critical thinking and problem solving.  Jobs of the future will still require graduates who have the ability to break down and solve complex problems.  Although the apparent focus in this course is on essential programming skills, you are beginning a journey to see the world through a computational lens.  While you will use AI tools in your future work, it won’t replace a human problem solver.  Considering this reality, you are allowed to use AI as a tool to assist you when completing your programming projects.  However, they must be used as a tool; you are not allowed to use them to replace thinking.  When AI is permitted, you will be required to upload your transcripts.  You are always expected to fully understand the work you submit.  If you choose to use AI, be warned:  you must complete the exams without the use of AI tools and you must do sufficiently well on the exams in order to pass the course.  I will work with you all in class to explore what it means to be able to read code, understand code, and troubleshoot.  As we navigate this journey, I want you to know from the start the importance of developing your own coding literacy while also being able to effectively leverage AI tools.

## Help - Academic Support and Tutoring

This course requires patience and persistence as computational thinking/programming is a craft.
It will likely be challenging.
We are committed to your success and want to be your first source for help. 
Please ask questions before, during and after class as well as visit during office hours.
I personally have an open-door policy: you are free to drop in anytime my office door is open or reach out to set up a separate meeting time.
Beyond your instructor, the Computing Success Center is a great place to find help. 
Free drop-in tutoring for CIS 163 is available during specific hours during the week but it is also a great space to hang out and work with others on group work!
See [Computing Success Center](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/student-success-center-13.htm) for a current schedule.
You can also contact the [GVSU tutoring center](http://www.gvsu.edu/tc/) for one-on-one tutoring.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

- Develop good quality programs in Python
- Manipulate fundamental data structures: lists (arrays), strings, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Solve problems using object-oriented principles (inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and interface classes, containers/collections, and iterators).
- Use UML class diagrams to represent the design of object-oriented programs.
- Analyze the run-time performance of algorithms using Big-O notation.
- Use appropriate tools for development (editor, debugger, etc.).
- Interpret technical programming documentation (Python API).

## Learning Management System

Course documents, videos, assignments, grades, links, and announcements will be posted to Github.  Labs and projects will be posted and completed on PrairieLearn.  It is your responsibility to stay informed.

## Programming Language and IDE

This courses uses [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  We use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the free development tool.

## Textbooks / Resources

In order to keep costs low, we will be using a variety of free online resources to introduce you to the Python programming language. Our text will be
Python Object-Oriented Programming - Fourth Edition, Steven F. Lott, Dusty Phillips
This book is freely available from O'Reilly through a GVSU subscription. You may access the book by going to [https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/](https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/). From there,

* Click the "Institution not listed" link
* Enter your GVSU email
* Click "Let's Go"
* Search for the book listed above

This course is not designed to be a lecture-only format, but rather an active learning community. For this to work, we expect you to read the assigned sections from the text (listed in the schedule) before coming to class. Questions from those sections will appear in class activities and on exams.

## Lab Activities

Our class meets each week for two hours in a computer lab. Attendance in lab is strictly required and half of your lab grade is based on attendance. To receive credit for attending, you must show up reasonably on-time and stay for the entire lab or until you finish the lab using your own work (e.g. simply dropping the entire lab into AI and attempting to leave will not receive credit). You will be given an activity that must be completed before the next week’s lab. You will work with a lab partner each week. This approach is called pair programming and is often used in industry to make the process more productive and enjoyable.

## Programming Projects

Projects are completed on your own time outside of class. The three projects increase in complexity as your abilities improve.  You will need to start early and budget enough time to complete the projects. 

While a certain amount of consultation between students working on a project is encouraged, the work you submit must be your own. Do not create a difficult situation by representing someone else's work as your own.  Make sure you cite your resources. For more information, consult the [Student Code](https://www.gvsu.edu/policies/category.htm?categoryId=2D0C8EF7-9959-9B01-959C403E725313F3), and the [College of Computing Guidelines for Academic Honesty](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

## Classroom Activities / Attendance

Students learn best when attending class regularly. As such, attendance in class is required. You are expected to attend and actively participate in class, and this will count for part of your grade. To receive credit for attendance and participation for a particular day, you must be in class, actively engaging, and complete any in-class activities.

In-class activities will often utilize peer instruction and be group activities tied to course content. These group activities have shown to be effective at increasing student motivation, academic performance, and attendance. Some in-class activities, paired or individual, may be required to be turned in, whereas others may be graded purely based on being in-class and completing them.

## Midterm Exams

You will take two midterm exams in-class during lab to demonstrate your understanding of key concepts and problem-solving skills.  You are allowed one 3x5 notecard of handwritten notes on the exam.  No magnifying glasses allowed, so it must be written large enough for you to read 🙂.  Other than that notecard, the midterms are closed-book/closed-note and you are not allowed to use any smart devices.

## Lab Exam

You will complete a lab exam towards the end of the term.  This is your opportunity to demonstrate your abilities working alone at a computer during the regularly scheduled lab session.  The lab exam is open notes and open book.

## Final Exam

A common final exam is taken by all CIS 163 sections on the Saturday afternoon before final exam week – **April 25th 1:00 - 3:00 pm.**

## Exam Retakes
You will have the opportunity to retake your midterm exams and the lab exam. If you choose to retake your exam, your overall exam score will be computed as a weighted average of the two scores, with the higher score weighted more heavily. More specifically, your overall score for that exam will be 0.15*lowerscore + 0.85*higherscore. Retake exams will cover the same general content as the original exam and be designed to be roughly the same difficulty, but the questions will be different. Retake exams will be taken out of class during available time slots spread over two days. You will need to sign-up to retake the exam for a time slot that works for you.

No retakes will be permitted on the final exam.

## Course Policies

- **You must earn a combined average of at least 60% between the midterm exams, lab exam and final exam to pass the course.**
- All programming projects, unless otherwise specified by the instructor, are to be completed individually. Students are encouraged to work with each other for general help only.
- Projects and labs turned in late occur a penalty of 10% per day, up to 3 days late.  In general, projects and labs turned in more than 3 days late will not receive credit.  Life happens, if you have extenuating circumstances, please talk with me.  
- Attendance is required.  You are allowed to miss up to 2 days of class without penalty.   If you attend the Success Center for at least 8 unique weeks during the semester, you are allowed to miss one additional day of class (you must check-in and stay for a minimum of 30 minutes).
- The instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course calendar, and due dates with sufficient notice via email and in-class announcements.

## Academic Honesty

All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information Systems, details can be found at [College of Computing Academic Honesty](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

I believe that you can learn a lot from your peers, both in the class and in the broader community. Therefore, I encourage collaboration with both.  However, do not mistake this as a license to cheat.   It is one thing to learn from and with your peers, it is another to pass their work off as your own.   With respect to writing code for this class:

* You are expected to document any collaboration that takes place.
* No electronic transfer of code between students is permitted.
* Any code that you find on the Internet must be cited, with an active link to that code. 
* While you are encouraged to engage in conversations in online forums, do not post solutions or solicit others to complete your work for you.
* Ultimately, you are responsible for all aspects of your submissions.  You should **be able to explain and defend** your submission if the work is entirely your own.
